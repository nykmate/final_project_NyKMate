# Importing data
```{r}
pokemon_data <- read.csv("/Users/Giga/Desktop/final_project/pokemon_df.csv")
```

## Pokemon type summary
```{r}
pokemon_types <- pokemon_data %>%
  count(type_1, sort = TRUE)

ggplot(pokemon_types, aes(x = reorder(type_1, n), y = n)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "navy") +

#The most common type is Water, while the rarest is Flying
```

### Tops (height, weight, attack)
```{r}
tallest_pokemon <- pokemon_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(height)) %>%
  slice_max(height, n = 1)
tallest_pokemon
#The tallest pokemon is Wailord

  filter(!is.na(height)) %>%
  slice_min(height, n = 1)
shortest_pokemon
#The following pokemons are the shortest with the same height: Joltik, Flabebe, Cutiefly, Comfey, Cosmoem

heaviest_pokemon <- pokemon_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  slice_max(weight, n = 1)
heaviest_pokemon
#The following pokemons are the heaviest with the same weight: Cosmoem (interesting, as it is also one of the shortest), Celesteela

lightest_pokemon <- pokemon_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  slice_min(weight, n = 1)
lightest_pokemon
#The following pokemons are the lightest (with the same weight): Gastly, Hunter, Flabebe, Cosmog, Kartana

strongest_pokemon <- pokemon_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(attack)) %>%
  slice_max(attack, n = 1)
strongest_pokemon
#Mewtwo-mega-x is the stongest pokemon
